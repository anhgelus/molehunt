# Introduction

[Molehunt](https://modrinth.com/mod/molehunt-mod) is a mod creating the Molehunt game in Minecraft.
You can watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJBjQ8T_1cc) to understand what it is.
If you are speaking French, I realized this [30 seconds video](https://cdn.anhgelus.world/molehunt-presentation.mp4) explaining the concept.

## Installation

Download the mod for your version.

The mod requires [Fabric-API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) to works.
[Simple Voice Chat](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat) is highly recommended.

The mod has to be installed on the server *and* on every client.
