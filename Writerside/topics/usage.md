# Using the mod

## Starting and stopping the game

To start a game, execute `/molehunt start` (you must be OP).

The game stops automatically if one of these two condition is met :
- Every alive player is a mole.
- The timer has run out.

The game does not automatically end when every mole is dead to allow for
funny moments. But if needed, you can stop the game early by using 
`/molehunt stop` (you must be OP).


## Player commands

The mod also provide a few commands for every player.

For moles only, using `/molehunt moles` will give you the list of the moles.

To some people, the timer above you hotbar could be annoying. To hide it,
use `/molehunt timer hide`. If you want to see it again, use 
`/molehunt timer show`.
